                <p><strong>1. [5 Points] Why is it important for an organization to have as much complete knowledge about their own internal organizational practices and assets as possible with respect to CRM?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Because these knowledge can define who is responsible and accountable for cyber risk management</li>
<li>According to the result internal organizational practices, we could find some point to improve</li>
<li>The more information you have about asset，the broader your risk management coverage</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>2. [5 Points] Within the concept of IT governance, what are 6 components of Enterprise Security?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>configuration management</li>
<li>identity and access management</li>
<li>threat and vulnerability management</li>
<li>awareness and training</li>
<li>privacy, physical security</li>
<li>compliance, auditing</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>3. [20 Points] Controls are an important part of helping mitigate risks. However, controls in place without proper monitoring may provide a false sense of security for an organization.</strong><br>
<strong>You've been asked been your management to address the following concerns about an implemented control related to applying security patches:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What are the consequences of not applying security patches on a routine basis?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>High-risk vulnerabilities may lead to malicious intrusion and use of company computers by hackers, resulting in company data leakage and major property losses.<br>
For example,computers in a TSMC production base were infected by the &quot;Eternal Bule&quot; virus because they did not install the security patch.This secutiy incident lead to the shutdown of many important production line, and revenue fell by 3% in the third quarter.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Are there any potential impacts to the business when applying these security patches?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This may cause the computer run slower, blue screen, or even terminate<br>
For example,a security patch applied by NASA caused monitoring equipment inside a large engineering furnace to shut down, sparking a fire that destroyed spacecraft hardware inside the furnace. Computer restarts caused by the software update also prevented the alarm from firing, leaving the fire unnoticed for 3.5 hours.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If there are risks, how will you mitigate agains them?</strong><br>
<strong>Address your management’s concerns with supporting evidence. You may find it useful to provide a specific example.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>After applying the security patches, we should check whether those devices, equipment, programs,etc. are working properly.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>4. [20 Points] When thinking about organizational Cybersecurity Risks, we must be thinking about it as an entire ecosystem, even for small organizations.</strong><br>
<strong>(a) [10 Points] Describe 3 internal risk categories that a company must examine. Provide 1 example for each category</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>data:hard disk</li>
<li>internal personnel:IT staff</li>
<li>Procedures：T/Biz standard and sensitive procedures</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(b) [10 Points] Describe 3 external risk categories that a company must examine. Provide 1 example for each category</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>physical environment risk:fire disaster</li>
<li>external personnel:strangers</li>
<li>third-part suppliers:software supplier</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>5. [50 Points] In class we discussed who may be the stakeholders with respect to JHU ISI and Cybersecurity Risks. Let’s examine a well-known public company that has ties to retail as well as cloud and information processing;Amazon.com, Inc (Nasdaq: AMZN).</strong><br>
<strong>(a) [15 Points] For AMZN retail business, describe who the stakeholders are and provide reasoning / proper justification for why you selected them.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>product manufacturer：pruduce product</li>
<li>logistic company：carry goods</li>
<li>merchant：sell product</li>
<li>consumer：purchase product</li>
<li>bank：payment</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(b) [15 Points] For AMZN cloud business (Amazon Web Serivces [AWS]), describe who the stakeholders are and provide reasoning / proper justification for why you selected them.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>technical staff：research and development group</li>
<li>third-part supplier：hardware, software suppliers</li>
<li>media: product publicity</li>
<li>consumer：users of cloud services</li>
<li>customer service： answer customer questions</li>
<li>cooperative partner： increase agility and reduce costs</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(c) [20 Points] Utilizing the recent (January 2022) disclosure of a vulnerability in AWS Glue service (see link below), explain how users of AWS services are potentially at risk and the mitigations that must be put into place by Amazon's security team to ensure each user's environment remains as secure as possible. (For the mitigations, this should be a high-level, policy based analysis).</strong><br>
<a href="https://orca.security/resources/blog/aws-glue-vulnerability/">https://orca.security/resources/blog/aws-glue-vulnerability/</a></p>
<p>A feature in AWS Glue can be used to obtain credentials for roles in one's own AWS account to gain full access to internal service APIs. Combined with an internal misconfiguration in Glue's internal service API, the ability to escalate privileges within an account to unrestricted access to all resources of a service in the region, as well as full administrative privileges.</p>
<p>As for mitigation measures，It is necessary to formulate targeted technical and management standards in combination with the characteristics of cloud computing services to reduce hidden dangers. Consolidate the authority control, configuration management, data access, cloud service monitoring, audit notification mechanism of the cloud computing platform. The construction of the cryptographic support system in cloud computing services, the business continuity requirements of cloud platforms and service level agreements, etc., all need to conduct more in-depth research and gradually form a standard system to ensure the security of cloud computing services.</p>
