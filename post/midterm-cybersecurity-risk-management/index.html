<h3 id="11-50-points-scenario-1-audit-preparation">1.1 [50 Points] Scenario 1 - Audit Preparation</h3>
<p><strong>Your organization is completing a Cyber Risk Self-Assessment in preparation for an upcoming audit. The audit is scheduled to take place over the course of 1 week and will begin in 1 month. The CISO would like you to focus on the data center audit. Using the following information and compliance requirements, prepare a report for your CISO (no more than 1 page) outlining what improvements should be made and how you will provide supporting evidence to show compliance to the auditors within the given timeframe.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Compliance requirements are:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Proper monitoring of the network.</li>
<li>Proper monitoring for malware on the server environments.</li>
<li>Proper protection of customer PII.</li>
<li>Proper segregation of user access and auditing.</li>
<li>SLA for patch management must be no longer than 2 weeks.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The relevant data center information is as follows:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Five (5) servers that host a custom application. Customers access this application over the Internet. In addition, customer information is stored within the fibre channel SAN which contains PII of the customers. The application utilizes AES-256 bit encryption to protect PII during transit, and no encryption within the storage. A vulnerability audit of the custom<br>
application code has been performed and validated.</li>
<li>Access to the data center is secured through biometrics. All members of the security team have access to the rack within the data center utilizing the same combination.</li>
<li>Endpoint agents have been installed on all servers. Currently, alerts generated by these agents are processed once per month.</li>
<li>Monthly maintenance plan to update and patch systems.</li>
<li>One core router and firewall that provide locked down ACLs to the environment without monitoring.</li>
<li>Dedicated out-of-band (OOB) management of the core infrastructure with only a single password utilizing a Raritan Dominion SXII (which is capable of using Active Directory/LDAP).</li>
</ul>
<p>According to 5 different compliance requirements， I found that improvements should be made. These certain policies and schemes provide supporting evidence to show compliance to the auditors.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Proper monitoring of the network.<br>
Firewall/Virtual Private Network (VPN) security hardware(core router) should have data flow monitoring, filtering, logging, and reporting capabilities, and can isolate internal and external network connections when necessary. It creates a barrier between the internal network and the unsecured external network, preventing illegal access to resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proper monitoring for malware on the server environments.<br>
We should use anti-virus software for inspection, monitoring, and anti-virus. Server environment security software should be updated regularly. Software is uniformly purchased and installed by the IT department. If you want to install other software on the server environment, you need to obtain the approval of the IT department. It is strictly forbidden to use malware, pirated software, or virus software on the company's server and internet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proper protection of customer PII.<br>
The application also needs to utilize AES-256-bit encryption to protect PII within the storage.<br>
Except for work needs, the computer equipment, software, disks, CD-ROMs, and other storage media for storing confidential information shall not be taken out of the company. If it is necessary to take it out of the work area due to work, it must be registered and filed for approval before it can be taken out. It is strictly forbidden to use storage media unrelated to work on the computer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proper segregation of user access and auditing.<br>
Not all members of the security team should be allowed access to the data center, and only specific members should be authorized so that when a security problem occurs, the cause of the problem can be more accurately traced and who is responsible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SLA for patch management must be no longer than 2 weeks.<br>
Improve update frequency, and formulate weekly maintenance plan to update and patch systems.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="12-50-points-scenario-2-mergeracquisition-preparation">1.2 [50 Points] Scenario 2 - Merger/Acquisition Preparation</h3>
<p><strong>You work for a multi-national corporation in the Pharmaceutical industry, Pharmco International. Pharmco is in the process of acquiring another business, Verti Pharma. Prior to completing the acquisition, the Board of Directors has requested an assessment of Verti’s cyber security posture.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CISO has tasked you with developing three (3) questions for helping assess the cybersecurity risk that will potentially be introduced upon acquisition and subsequent merging of Verti's IT infrastructure into the Pharmco system. These questions should be designed to gain more understanding of the Verti network and security posture. In addition, develop a list of eight (8) recommendations that should be made based on the following known information regarding the Verti IT and Security posture.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pharmco has 20 locations throughout North America, Europe and Asia. The main HQs is in Boston.</li>
<li>Pharmco utilizes a unified Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) based on Elastic Search. They would like to continue to have a unified SIEM.</li>
<li>Verti has 2 locations: 1 in California and 1 in Boston.</li>
<li>Verti has 100 employees in California, 500 in Boston and 50 remote-only workers.</li>
<li>Verti has a site-to-site VPN between California and Boston. This VPN utilizes DES, shared secrets and DH Group 2 for its settings.</li>
<li>Verti has 10 Windows Server 2008 and 5 Windows Server 2019 systems. They have an Active Directory (AD) forest with 2 domains (boston.verti.dom and cali.verti.dom). Group Policy Objects (GPO) are used to manage the systems. Event logging is enabled to monitor security events including successful and failed logon attempts. These logs are pushed to a Splunk SIEM but are not monitored.</li>
<li>Verti has 5 Linux systems all running kernel version 4.16.2.</li>
<li>Verti internal IP space utilizes 172.16.0.0/16 space. Pharmco utilizes 10.0.0.0/8. Pharmco would like to have these IP spaces remain separated.</li>
<li>Verti remote employees utilize VPNs to access the internal services. An OpenVPN environment is used in which each client has their own unique certificate. No multi-factor authentication is enabled. No monitoring of the VPN connectivity is currently being performed. Each client from the VPN has access to the corporate network as if they were physically located in an office.</li>
<li>Verti hosts their own e-mail system utilizing three (3) Microsoft Exchange Server 2016 systems, specifically build number 15.1.1779.2.</li>
<li>Verti provides a sophisticated anti-phishing technology aligned with user awareness training.</li>
<li>Verti’s firewall is currently not configured for logging any traffic.</li>
<li>Verti has not had a 3rd party vulnerability assessment nor an internal vulnerability scan.</li>
</ul>
<p>**Question 1: **<br>
How the Verti manage different assets information? What methods have been adopted? How many assets have been collected?</p>
<p><strong>Question 2:</strong><br>
What are the response policies for a hack or a system compromise? If a hacker hacked into Verti's internet, What is your emergency response mechanism? And how do you trace and stop this attack?</p>
<p><strong>Question 3:</strong><br>
What security software system or hardware is used in Verti? What is the interaction between them?</p>
<p><strong>Eight Recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is recommended to keep the same version of Windows Server. A unified version facilitates efficient management.</li>
<li>These logs are pushed to a Splunk SIEM and should be monitored.</li>
<li>Multi-factor authentication should be enabled when employees use a VPN.</li>
<li>Each VPN connectivity should be monitored. Ban the VPN timely that do risk operations.</li>
<li>Each VPN account must be independently authorized before it can access the company network.</li>
<li>The permissions of the company network should also be atomized, and access can only be obtained after separate authorization.</li>
<li>Verti’s firewall should be configured for logging the traffic, and based on the traffic can do some attack risk analysis</li>
<li>Verti should find a 3rd party vulnerability assessment or implement an internal vulnerability scan. Find and fix bugs promptly.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="13-25-points-cyber-security-risk-thoughts">1.3 [25 Points] Cyber Security Risk Thoughts...</h3>
<p><strong>Please choose one (1) question from the following. Be sure to provide justification and use at least two (2) examples to show your thought process.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>It is possible to be compliant with all aspects of a risk management framework and still have vulnerabilities in your enviornment. Why is this the case providing at least two (2) examples.</li>
<li>Based on the information we’ve covered in the semester up till now, what are two of the most challenging aspect of cybersecurity risk management and why?</li>
<li>Which parts of the cyber risk assessment process can be automated? Which parts cannot be automated?</li>
<li>How would you apply the cyber risk assessment process to your own personal electronic devices and data?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>I choose Question 1</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When risk management framework is designed, it is almost certainly an open environment, that is, it interacts with the outside world. This risk management system contains its state, as well as its interactions, and its state naturally changes with interactions. The system can be thought of as a finite state machine. But in fact it cannot be a strict finite state machine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The existence of the risk management system because the demand exists, people cannot predict future demands, nor can they accurately realize existing demands. Therefore, there is a need for system upgrades. The inherent mechanism of upgrading means changing the system, making the behavior of the system uncertain. Therefore, the vulnerability is also uncertain.</p>
</li>
