                <p><strong>1. [10 Points] According to Kohnke, et al., what are five (5) outcomes of a properly implemented set of cybersecurity controls?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Accurately identify and authenticate all entities seeking access to a system</li>
<li>Authorize access to only those objects that the entity’s level of trust permits</li>
<li>Monitor and control activities during the time that the entity is granted access</li>
<li>Ensure against unauthorized access, or manipulation of data</li>
<li>Ensure against unauthorized manipulation of system objects</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>2. [30 Points] One of the first steps in identifying the risks in an organization is to collect as much complete information as we can about the critical assets of the company. One method is to interview the key stakeholders and get their insight into what they believe is critical components from a risk standpoint. A secondary approach is to perform an independent assessment. Why is it important to perform these two assessments? What might be missed if we relied soley on one or the other? (provide one example where performing method 1 but not 2 and vice verse).</strong></p>
<p>Because performing these two assessments can improve the comprehensiveness and accuracy of the evaluation results. Many risks in an organization are hidden and not easy to find. Key stakeholders often have a more comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the organization's situation, so valuable risk information is often in their heads. The independent assessment can exclude the subjective ideas of key stakeholders and make the evaluation results more objective.</p>
<p>For example, if performing method 1 but not 2, Key stakeholders in the company may be reluctant to expose risks within their management scope because they fear their management capabilities will be challenged.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>3. [15 Points] Why is complete protection a difficult proposition for most companies? Describe at least 2 distinct reasons why this is so.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Important information in a company can exist in many ways, it may be in a computer, it may be a paper document, or it may exist in the mind of an employee. Much information is invisible and dynamic, making it difficult to track and manage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The company has electronic protection measures in the software or network, and also has a set of independent physical security solutions. Physical and electronic security are two separate domains, so it is difficult to reconcile the two to achieve comprehensive protection.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>4. [10 Points] There are a few common frameworks used for risk management and controls implementation. Each of these have much overlap in what they define. With respect to controls specifically, what must an implementer of the controls be able to show in order to ensure they are within compliance of the regulation (Hint: Provide a specific example to help you).</strong></p>
<p>An implementer of the controls must be able to show that unauthorized participants access to resources is properly restricted.For example, a normal user cannot unauthorized access to background management functions.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>5. [10 Points] After successful implementation of a policy, how often should the policy be reviewed? Provide evidence for your choice.</strong><br>
<strong>(a) When there is a significant change in the policy.</strong><br>
<strong>(b) The policy should not change after successful implementation.</strong><br>
<strong>(c) The policy should be reviewed annually and when a significant change occurs.</strong><br>
<strong>(d) The policy should only be reviewed annually.</strong></p>
<p>My choice is（C）.First, a successfully implemented policy still has room for optimization, and regular reviews can find and solve problems in a timely manner. Second, when big changes occur, policies that have been implemented before are likely to no longer work. For example, there is a policy to back up the full amount of data every day, but when the amount of data is too large, each backup takes more than one day, then the strategy needs to be readjusted, such as adjusting the backup cycle, or ignoring unimportant log files during backup .</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>6. [25 Points] You have been tasked with implementing a new procedure at your company. All offices have a badge reader on the doors, including the Network Operations Center (NOC) and Security Operations Center (SOC). All employees must now wear an identification badge with your full name, social security number and date of birth. This ID badge must be presented to the readers for entry. All employees will have access to the NOC and SOC.</strong><br>
<strong>(a) [5 Points] Why might an organization want to implement an ID badge policy?</strong></p>
<p>it can improve the safety of the company and prevent outsiders from entering casually.</p>
<p><strong>(b) [10 Points] Why is this specific approach a really bad idea? (provide at least two (2) distinct reasons)</strong></p>
<p>First，there are sensitive information on the identification badge, such as full name, SSN and date of birth.If these information is leaked, it may affect the safety of life and property.Second，all employees will have access to the NOC and SOC.These two places are the core of the company's security, and any employee may be a potential threat.</p>
<p><strong>(c) [10 Points] Suggest at least two (2) changes that will improve this policy.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Do not include sensitive information on the badge, you can replace it with an alias or job number</li>
<li>Implement access control. Departments with high security levels such as NOC and SOC only allow employees with senior management privileges to enter.</li>
<li>The badge should have the employee's own message, not mine.</li>
</ul>
